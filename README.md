# SalahAPI Specification

## Overview

The **SalahAPI Specification** defines a standard, language-agnostic interface for exchanging Islamic prayer times (Salah) data across services and applications. This specification enables both humans and computers to discover and understand the structure of prayer times data without requiring access to source code, documentation, or network traffic inspection.

When properly defined through SalahAPI, applications can understand and interact with prayer times services with minimal implementation logic.
